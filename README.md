# Bootcamp-Project-1-Python

#### Based on what youâ€™ve learned until now, create a project of your choosing (impress us with your imagination). This project must at least satisfy the following minimum requirements:

- Use at least 3 different data types.
- Use lists or dictionaries or tuples or sets.
- Use loops.
- Use functions that return an output.
- Use conditions.
- Use a Lambda function.


### Example: Riyadh Season Reservations

#### Overview: An online website that shows different events. The visitor should be able to do the following tasks for the store to function properly. As a visitor, I should be able to do the following:

- Browse Events.
- View the event info (summary, time, price, place, etc.)
- Search for an Event.
- Get recommendations for my next visit based on my ticket purchase history.
- Add tickets to the shopping cart.
- Remove a ticket from the shopping cart.
- List the tickets in my shopping cart.
- Modify the number of the ticket (by default one ticket).
- Continue to checkout.
- Get a QR code for my ticket.
- Review my coming events.

#### Final Deliverables:
- Notebook file(.ipynb).
- README.md file.
- Due Date: Sat, 20, at 09:00 p.m.
- The Final presentation will be on Sunday (5 min for each one).
